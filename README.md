VEP is a ML enabled system developed for the course "Software Engineering for AI-enabled Systems" of the Aldo Moro University of Bari.  
The project idea derive from a Kaggle competition named "INGV - Volcanic Eruption Prediction" aimed at building ML models to predict when a volcano's next eruption will occur. 
The competition provides a geophysical dataset build by Italy's Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) and consisting of readings from several seismic sensors 
deployed on active volcanoes.   
The models identify signatures in seismic waveforms that characterize the development of an eruption.  
More information about the system are available at the [wiki page](https://github.com/se4ai2122-cs-uniba/Volcanic-eruption-prediction/wiki).
