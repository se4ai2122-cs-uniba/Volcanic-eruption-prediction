This project derive from a Kaggle competition named "INGV - Volcanic Eruption Prediction" aimed at building ML models to predict when a volcano's next eruption will occur. 
The competition provides a geophysical dataset build by Italy's Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) and consisting of readings from several seismic sensors 
deployed on active volcanoes. 
The models identify signatures in seismic waveforms that characterize the development of an eruption.
